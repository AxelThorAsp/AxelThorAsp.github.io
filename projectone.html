            <p class="text">"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party" is a phrase first proposed as a typing drill by instructor Charles E. Weller; its use is recounted in his book The Early History of the Typewriter, p. 21 (1918).[1] Frank E. McGurrin, an expert on the early Remington typewriter, used it in demonstrating his touch typing abilities in January 1889.[2] It has appeared in a number of typing books, often in the form "Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country."[3]</p>
